<html><body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>John and Brus are the managers of your football team.
The team is taking part in a tournament.
The tournament is almost over: each team still has exactly two matches to play (possibly both against the same opponent).
Note that two different teams play in each match.
<br></br><br></br>

There are no ties in this tournament.
Each match is played until one of the two teams wins.
The winner of a match gets 3 points, the loser gets 0 points.
<br></br><br></br>

You are given an int <b>yourScore</b>: the number of points your team has scored so far.
You are also given two vector &lt;int&gt;s <b>scores</b> and <b>numberOfTeams</b> that describe the other teams.
For each valid i, there are <b>numberOfTeams</b>[i] other teams that each have scored <b>scores</b>[i] points so far.
Note that the total number of teams in the tournament is 1 + sum(<b>numberOfTeams</b>).
<br></br><br></br>

At the end of the tournament, teams will be ranked by the total number of points.
Teams with the same number of points will be ranked according to their total score.
<br></br><br></br>

Given the above information, you are interested in the best possible (1-based) final rank of your team.
Note that you do not know which matches are still to be played, so you assume the best possible combination of matches that is consistent with the given information.
<br></br><br></br>

In other words, you want to find the smallest X such that there exists a valid set of future match results that causes your team to end in X-th place.
Note that your team's score can be arbitrarily good, so you may always assume that your team is placed above all other teams that have the same score as you.
<br></br><br></br>

Compute and return the X defined above.
